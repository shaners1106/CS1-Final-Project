# CS1 Final Project

This repository holds my final project from my CS1 course. This project introduces object oriented programming, separation of header and implementation files, user input error handling using while loops, and my most in depth work with array data structures up to this point in my course work.  The program is a pizza restaurant simulation.  It caters to prospective customers.  It begins by prompting the customer (user) with pizza order information, including crust choices, topping choices and prices.  It then prompts the user to build 5 single topping pizzas and outputs the customer's choice after each pizza order.  At the end it outputs the bill total that the customer (user) has accumulated.

## Main.cpp

The program's main implementation file

## Pizza.h

The header file for pizza objects

## Pizza.cpp
